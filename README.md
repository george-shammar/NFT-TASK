# PKT NFT

This is a simple NFT minter application that give users the opportunity to mint their own NFTs. Multiple NFTs can be minted at once by users. The application uses IPFS as storage for NFT metadata and the IPFS url is dynamically generated.

The frontend uses minimal design and users can connect to their metamask wallet to sign off transactions (gas fee) in order to mint. The design is responsive with different break points adapted for mobile, tablet and desktop versions.
